Foundations of Git & GitHub

---------------------------------------------
Alright everyone, welcome to the Git and GitHub course.

Before we start, let me be very clear —
Git and GitHub are mandatory skills for every full-stack developer.
Frontend, backend, DevOps, data science — doesn’t matter.

If you’re writing code and working in a team, you must know Git.

------------------------------------------------

Lecture 1: Introduction to Git & Version Control System

In this session, we are going to understand Git in a very simple way
and also understand why Git is so important.
Git is so important that every single tech company uses it.

It can be:
a small startup
or a big company like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix

Every tech company uses Git.

------------------------------------------------------

Before Definition – Let’s Understand the Problem

Before we jump into any formal definition,
let’s first understand the real problem Git solves.

Problem 1: Managing Code as a Solo Developer

Even if you are working alone, managing code is difficult.

You face problems like:
Multiple versions of your code
No proper history of changes
No clear backup
Confusion like: “Which file was correct?”

As your project grows, these problems grow too.
----------
Problem 2: Working in a Team

Now imagine working in a team:
5 developers
10 developers
or even 50+ developers

One person changes a file.
Everyone else needs that change.

Another person changes another file.
You need that change.

If everyone starts copying files manually:

copy-paste
Google Drive
Dropbox
zip files

It becomes impossible to manage.
---------
Problem 3: What If Your System Crashes?

Very important question.
What if:
your laptop crashes?
your hard disk fails?
All your project files are gone.
This is a real risk.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Git Solves All These Problems

This is where Git comes into the picture.

Git helps us to:
manage code properly
track every change
work with teams easily
keep backup safely
maintain complete history
-------
Git + Remote Repository

With Git, we usually use an online repository.
This repository:
stores your code safely
keeps a record of every change
has timestamps
has messages explaining why a change was made
So even if your system crashes,
your code is safe online.

-----------

Code Synchronization Made Easy

When you make changes:
you tell Git: “I’ve made these changes”
you upload them to the online repository
Other team members just run a few commands
and they get your changes.

Same way:
when they make changes
you can pull those changes

No copy-paste.
No confusion.

--------
Version Tracking

Git also helps you manage versions.

Example:

Version 1.0 – basic features
Version 1.1 – new feature added
Version 1.2 – bug fixes

Git knows:
what feature was added in which version
who wrote which line of code
at what time
-----------

Going Back in Time (Very Powerful)

If a new feature breaks something:
you don’t delete code
you don’t rewrite everything
You just tell Git:
“Take me back to the previous version”

That’s it.
This works for every team member.
--------

Git History

Each time you submit code:

you add a message
Git creates a record
So later, you can clearly see:
what was changed
why it was changed
who changed it
--------

New Team Member? No Problem

If a new developer joins your team:
you don’t send zip files
you don’t send Google Drive links
You just share:
the repository link

They run a few commands
and get the entire project with full history.

---------------------------------------

Simple Definition of Git

Now let’s look at the definition.

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system,
designed to handle everything from small to very large projects
with speed and efficiency.

The important words here are:
Distributed Version Control System

-------------------------------------------
Types of Version Control Systems

There are mainly three types:

1. Local Version Control
Multiple copies of the same project
Everything stored on one system
Very risky
Not recommended

2. Central Version Control
One central server
Team sends changes to it
But local history is limited

3. Distributed Version Control (Git)
This is what Git uses.
In Git:
every developer has full project history locally
online repository also has full history
everyone stays in sync
This makes Git very powerful and safe.

------------------

Git and Commands
As developers, we use Git mostly through:
terminal
Git Bash
There are GUI tools also,
but in companies, command-line Git is mandatory.

Online Repositories

You can use:
GitHub
GitLab
Bitbucket

In this course, we’ll use GitHub

-------------------------------------


Git Download, Installation & Environment Setup

This includes:

Downloading Git
Installing Git
Verifying installation
Creating a GitHub account
Setting up our editor
Basic project folder setup
-------
Step 1: Check If Git Is Already Installed

Before downloading anything,
let’s first check if Git is already present on your system.

Open:
CMD or PowerShell → if you’re on Windows
Terminal → if you’re on Mac or Linux

Now type this command:

git --version

-------------

Step 2: Download Git

If Git is not installed,
open your browser and go to the official Git website.

You can:

search for Git download on Google
or directly visit the official website

The site will:
auto-detect your operating system
show the correct download button

Click Download, save the installer, and open it.

----------------

Step 3: Install Git

During installation:

Keep clicking Next
No special configuration needed
Default settings are perfectly fine
Once installation is complete:
Click Finish
Git Bash will also be installed automatically
Installation is now done.

--------

Verify Git Installation

Now reopen:

CMD / Terminal / Git Bash

Again run:

git --version

If you see the version:
👉 Git is successfully installed
👉 You are ready to use Git commands

------------

GitHub Registration

Now let’s talk about GitHub.

GitHub is an online repository
where we will store our code.

For now, you only need to:
Create a free account
Sign up using email
Verify your account
Log in
Once logged in:
Open your profile
Note these three things:
Username
Email
Name

These details will be important later.

-----------------------


Git Configuration – Name & Email

now let us quickly configure two very important things in Git:

User name
User email
These two configurations are mandatory.
-------
Why Is This Configuration Important?

Whenever we work on a project:
Git tracks every change
Git also tracks who made that change
In real companies:
multiple developers work on the same project
managers and teammates need to know
👉 who did what
That information comes from:
your name
your email

-----------

What Git Records

Every time you make a change:

Git stores your name
Git stores your email
Git stores the time
Git stores the change
So later, anyone can see:
this line of code was written by this person
at this time
using this system

----------------------

Configure Email

Now type the following command:

git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

Replace the email with:
👉 the same email you used on GitHub

Important:

--global means this setting applies to your entire system

You don’t need to configure this again for every project
Press Enter.

----------------------

Configure Name

Now configure your name.

Type:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Use:
your real name
or your GitHub display name
Press Enter.

-------------------

Verify Configuration

To verify everything, type:

git config --list

Press Enter.

You should see:
user.name
user.email

This confirms that:
👉 Git is successfully configured on your system.

--------------

Example Explanation to Students

If you later modify:

index.html
or any other file
Git will record:
this change was done by you
using this system
at this time
This is extremely important in team projects.

-------

About Git Bash

Now let me talk about Git Bash.

During Git installation:
Git Bash is installed automatically
Git Bash:
is designed specifically for Git
supports Linux-style commands
works perfectly with Git
You can open Git Bash and run:

git --version

All Git commands work the same.
Which Terminal Should You Use?
You can use:
CMD
PowerShell
Git Bash
Terminal (Mac/Linux)

Important point:
👉 Git commands remain the same everywhere

Use whichever terminal you are comfortable with.



--------------------------------

Git Basics, Lifecycle & Core Commands

Alright everyone,
now it’s time to get serious and understand how Git actually works.

Till now:

we installed Git
we configured Git
we set up our environment
Now we’ll talk about:
Git lifecycle
how history is saved
and the most important beginner commands

------------------------------------

Local System vs Online System

There are two places involved:

Local system
your laptop or computer
Online system
an online repository
also called a remote repository
A repository simply means:
👉 a container that stores your project files and history
-------
Git vs GitHub (Very Important)

Remember this clearly:
Git → tool that tracks changes
GitHub → service that stores code online
GitHub is just a provider.
Other providers:
GitLab
Bitbucket
Concept remains the same everywhere.

------------------

Where We Actually Work (Working Directory)

On your system:
you create files
write code
delete files
modify content
This place is called:
👉 Working Directory

Example:
index.html
images
CSS files
JS files

Everything starts here.

------------

Why We Need Staging Area

When we want to save history,
we don’t save directly.
We do it in steps.
First step:
👉 Staging Area
Staging area allows us to:
review changes
organize what we want to save
decide what should go into history

--------------------

step-by-Step Git Lifecycle

The Git lifecycle works like this:

1️Working Directory
2️Staging Area
3️Local Repository
4️Online Repository (optional)

-------------
Git Add → Staging Area

When we run:
git add

We are saying:
👉 “Git, take these changes and move them to staging area”

Example:

new file
updated code
deleted line

All tracked here.

----------------------------

Git Commit → Local Repository

When we run:

git commit

We are saying:
👉 “Git, take a snapshot of staged changes”

A commit:

stores files
stores changes
stores name
stores email
stores time
stores a message

This snapshot is saved in:
👉 Local Repository

-----------------

Git Push → Online Repository

When everything looks good and tested:

git push

We send:
files
history
commits
To:
👉 GitHub or any remote repository
This makes code:
shareable
safe
accessible
--------------

Simple Example (Explain While Coding)

Let’s say:

I open index.html
I add a <h1>Hello World</h1>
Right now:
file is in working directory
Then:
git add .
change goes to staging area
Then:
git commit -m "added index page"
snapshot saved in local repository
Then later:
git push

code goes to online repository

-----------------------
Core Lifecycle flow
Work → Stage → Commit → Push
-----------------------

Basic Git Commands

Command 1: git init

This command is mandatory.

git init
Meaning:
👉 “Git, start tracking this folder”
Without this:
Git does not know what to track
This creates a hidden folder:
.git
This folder stores:
history
configuration
commits
branches
----------------------

Command 2: git status
git status

This tells us:
what files are untracked
what files are staged
what is ready to commit
You should use this very frequently.

----------------------

Command 3: git add

To add everything:

git add .
To add a single file:
git add index.html

This moves changes to:
staging area

---------------

Command 4: git commit
git commit -m "your message"


Message should explain:

what you did

why you did it

Examples:

added login page
fixed header bug
updated styles

-----------------

Command 5: git log
git log

This shows:
commit history
author name
email
date
commit message
commit ID

This is how teams track:
👉 who did what and when
------------------

Branch Rename (Master → Main)

By default, Git uses master.

Industry standard now is:
👉 main

Rename using:

git branch -M main

---------------------------

Connecting to Remote Repository

To connect GitHub:

git remote add origin <repo-link>

Meaning:

remote → online repository
origin → nickname for link
Now Git remembers this link.

-------------

Pushing to GitHub
git push -u origin main
Meaning:
push changes
to origin
on main branch

-u sets default tracking.

----------------

What Happens After First Time

You do NOT run all commands every time.

Usually workflow is:

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push

That’s it.

--------------------

Pushing Code to GitHub (Remote Repository)

now let’s move to the next important step.

Till now:
we created files
added them to staging area
committed them to local repository

Now it’s time to:
👉 push all our changes to an online server

-----------------

What Do We Mean by Online Server?

By online server, I mean:
an online container
also called a remote repository
This is where:
our code
our commit history
our project
will be stored online.

In our case, this online container is GitHub.

-------------

Step 1: Create an Online Repository on GitHub

First, open your browser and go to:

👉 github.com/new
This will allow you to:
create a new repository
which will act as a container for our project

Repository Name

Give your repository a name.
I recommend:
using the same name as your project folder

Example:
Project folder: SplitMate
Repository name: SplitMate
This keeps things simple.

Visibility

You can choose:
Public → anyone can see your code
Private → only you can see your code
For now:
choose Public (recommended for learning)

Click Create Repository.

------------------------

Step 2: Why Authentication Is Needed

Now pause and understand this carefully.

GitHub needs to verify:
👉 “Is this person really the owner of this account?”

On your local system:
Git knows your name and email
but GitHub doesn’t trust local info alone
So we need a secure way to authenticate.

That’s where:
👉 Personal Access Token (PAT) comes in

------------------

Step 3: Generate Personal Access Token

Go to:

GitHub → Profile
Settings
Developer settings
Personal access tokens
Fine-grained tokens

Click Generate new token.

oken Details

Give a name
Example: My Desktop or Office Laptop

Set expiry
Example: 30 days (recommended for practice)

Select permissions
For now, select full repository access

Click Generate Token.

Important Warning (Tell Students Clearly)

⚠️ This token is shown only once
⚠️ Copy it immediately
⚠️ Save it somewhere safe

This token works like:
👉 your GitHub password for Git
------------------------
Command: Add Remote Repository

Type:

git remote add origin <repository-url>


Explanation:

remote → online repository
add → connect a new remote
origin → nickname for the URL
<repository-url> → GitHub repo link
We use origin by convention.
Press Enter.

Now your local system knows:
👉 where to push code online

------------------------

Ensure Correct Branch (Main)
By default, Git uses master.

Industry standard now is:
👉 main

Rename branch using:
git branch -M main

To check current branch:
git branch

You should see:
👉 * main

---------------

Push Code to GitHub

Now we are ready to push.

Run:
git push -u origin main

Explanation:

push → send changes
origin → remote repository
main → branch
-u → set default upstream

------------

Authentication (Very Important)

At this point:
GitHub will ask for credentials

Enter:

Username → your GitHub username
Password → paste the personal access token
⚠️ Password will be invisible — this is normal.

Press Enter.

--------------------

Verify on GitHub

Now go back to your browser.
Refresh your GitHub repository.

You should see:

your files
commit history
commit message
time of commit

Your local history is now:
👉 successfully pushed online

---------------------

Understanding the Timeline

Notice something important.

If GitHub shows:
“34 minutes ago”
That’s because:

commit time is recorded locally
GitHub just receives the history
Git does not change timestamps.
Matching Local and Online History

Run locally:
git log

On GitHub:
open the commit
You will see:
same commit message
same commit ID
same author
same time

This proves:
👉 Git history is preserved exactly

------------------------------------------

Practicing Git Commands (Hands-On)

Alright everyone,
in this lecture we are not learning anything new.

We are simply going to:

practice the commands
understand how Git behaves
see how changes move from local → staging → commit → GitHub

This lecture is only about playing with Git.

-------------

Step 1: Check Current Status

Before doing anything, let’s always check where we are.

Run:
git status

This command tells us:
are there any changes?
are files modified?
are files staged?

Right now, there are no changes.

----------

Step 2: Make a Small Change

Let’s modify index.html.

I’ll:
delete existing content
save the file
Now go back to terminal and run:
git status

You’ll see:
👉 modified: index.html
Why “modified”?
Because:
Git is already tracking this file

we changed its content
--------------

Step 3: Modify File Again

Now I’ll add some code.
I’ll:
use boilerplate HTML
add project title
save the file

Again, run:
git status

You’ll still see:
👉 modified: index.html
This confirms:
we are still in working directory
changes are not staged yet

---------------

Step 4: Move Changes to Staging Area

Now let’s move changes to staging area.

Run:
git add .

This means:
👉 add all modified files
Now check status again:
git status

You’ll see:
file name in green
message: changes to be committed

This means:
👉 file is now in staging area

--------------

Step 5: Add Another File

Now let’s create a new file:
about.html

Add some text inside it and save.

Now run:

git status
You’ll see:
new file detected
file is untracked

-------------------

Step 6: Add New File to Staging Area

Now stage everything again:
git add .

Check status:
git status

Now staging area contains:
modified index.html
new about.html

------------------

Step 7: Commit Changes

Now we take a snapshot.

Run:
git commit -m "updated index and added about page"

This does:

stores files
stores changes
stores author info
stores message

Now check:
git status

You’ll see:
👉 nothing to commit
Meaning:
working directory is clean
changes are saved in local repository

--------------------

Step 8: View Commit History

Now check history:
git log
You’ll see:

latest commit
previous commit
author name
commit message
commit ID

This shows complete history.

-----------

Understanding HEAD and Origin

Now observe carefully.

HEAD → your current position
origin/main → last commit pushed to GitHub
Right now:
HEAD is ahead
origin/main is behind

Why?
Because:
we committed locally
but we haven’t pushed yet

----------------

Step 9: Push Changes to GitHub

Now let’s push:

git push origin main
Once pushed:

GitHub gets latest commits
origin/main moves forward
Refresh GitHub repository.

You’ll now see:
new files
new commit message

correct timestamps

-----------------

Step 10: Verify Commit on GitHub

Click on the commit.

You can see:

what file changed
what lines were added
what lines were removed

This is exactly how:
👉 teams review code

-----------------

Step 11: Make More Changes (Partial Staging)

Now let’s try something different.

Modify:

index.html
about.html
Save both.
Check status:

git status


You’ll see:
👉 both files modified

Step 12: Stage Only One File

Now stage only index.html:

git add index.html

Check status again:

git status

You’ll notice:

index.html → staged (green)

about.html → not staged

This proves:
👉 staging area lets you control what to commit

Step 13: Commit Only One File
Now commit:
git commit -m "updated index page"

Only index changes are committed.
About page is still pending.

---------------

Step 14: Push This Commit
git push origin main

Check GitHub:
only index changes are visible
about page change is not pushed yet

Step 15: Commit Remaining File
Now stage about page:

git add about.html

Commit it:

git commit -m "updated about page"
Push it:

git push origin main
Now everything is synced.

----------------------

Step 16: Short Commit History View

Instead of long logs, use:

git log --oneline
This shows:

short commit ID
commit message
HEAD and origin position

Very useful for daily work.
---------------
